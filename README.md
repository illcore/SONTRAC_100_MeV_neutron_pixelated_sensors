# SOlar Neutron TRACking (SONTRAC) detector concept based on Kuraray Y11-200(M) scintillation fibers in GEANT4
Reference:  https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2407.01616
* 34 x 34 scintillating fiber bundle.
* Kuraray Y11-200(M) scintillation fibers.
* 34 x 34 pixelated sensors on each side (four).
* Secondary particle tracking within the fiber components;
* One is suppsoed to use the executable+run1.mac without any change to employ the GEANT4 package appropriately;
* If/when necessary, one is supposed to remove/close the visualization macro (vis.mac) in run1.mac to prevent any possible computer crash.
